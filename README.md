# Automated Literature Analysis 
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/206312286.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/206312286)

This repository shows an example of how to perform an automated analysis of academic literature using Jupyter notebooks and online citation databases such as Scopus, DBLP, and Semantic Scholar. This analysis detects the number of publications over time, popular authors, popular venues, popular affiliations, and popular "topics" that appear within the documents' abstracts (detected using natural language processing).


## Requirements
The required Python packages can be found in `requirements.txt`. Creating a virtual Python environment is recommended (for example, `virtualenv` or `conda`). The notebook has been tested using Python 3.6. 

Scopus is a citation database of peer-reviewed literature from scientific journals, books, and conference proceedings.
To utilize the Scopus API, you (or your institute) needs a Scopus subscription and you must request an Elsevier Developer API key (see [Elsevier Developers](https://dev.elsevier.com/sc_apis.html) and [Scopus Python API](https://scopus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more information). 


# Running using virtualenv
Installation using `virtualenv` is can be using the following commands:

Create virtualenv environment named myenv:
```
virtualenv myenv --python=`which python3`
```

Activate virtual environment
```
source ./myenv/bin/activate
```

Install requirement dependencies.
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Install new Jupyter kernel.
```
ipython kernel install --user --name=myenv
```

Run Jupyter and select `myenv` as kernel. Remaining instructions can be found within the notebook itself.
```
jupyter notebook literature_analysis.ipynb --MappingKernelManager.default_kernel_name=myenv
```



## Examples
Below are examples of the notebook's output for the query `title-abs-key("predictive maintenance")`.

 ## Scopus Error
09/12/2019 Solved the "Scopus401Error: Invalid API Key".
After run the block "Perform Search" in Jupyter for the first time, I was asked to fill in the API Key, then I got the "Scopus401Error: Invalid API Key". To refilled in the API key, it is necessary to remove the cache stored in the directory .scopus. Run this:
```
$ cd ~/.scopus
$ rm -rf .scopus
```
